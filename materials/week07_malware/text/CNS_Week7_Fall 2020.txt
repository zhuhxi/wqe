Malicious Software (Malware)

There are a number of categories of malicious software including:
     – Viruses
     – Worms
     – Trojan Horses
     – Rootkits
     – Backdoors
     – Spyware
     – Fake AV
     – Botnets
     – Keystroke loggers
     – Logicbombs




P3
Viruses

 A Virus is a computer program that is designed to replicate itself by copying
 itself into other programs stored in a computer.


 The ‘virus’ may be benign or may carry a malicious payload that can cause a
 program to operate incorrectly or corrupt a computer's memory.


 A computer virus behaves in a way similar to a biological virus, which spreads
 by inserting itself into living cells. Extending the analogy, the insertion of the
 virus into a program is termed an infection, and the infected file (or executable
 code that is not part of a file) is called a host.


 The first virus is believed to be the Creeper virus that spread through
 ARPANET (the precursor to the internet) in 1971. It copied itself to remote
 systems where the message “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can!” was
 displayed.


 P4
Viruses
 Many early viruses spread via floppy disks. Users often exchanged data and
 programs on disks, and machines would boot from floppy disk by default (if
 present).


 Viruses spread by either infecting programs stored on disks or installed them
 into the disk boot sector to be run when the machine booted. As BBS’s
 became popular, viruses were written to infect popular, often traded software.


 Macro viruses started to appear in the 1990’s. Macro languages are languages
 built into software applications (e.g. Microsoft Office). This allows code to be
 embedded in documents that can run when opened. So if a document that
 contains a macro virus is transported to different machines, the virus will go
 with it.


 As macros are application based, and not dependent on the operating system,
 the same macro virus can spread across different systems.

 P5
Viruses

To spread itself, a virus must be allowed to execute code and write to memory.
Often, viruses will attach themselves to legitimate programs, to be executed
when the program is launched.


There are two types of possible behavior when a virus is executed:
Non-resident viruses – on execution they search for and infect other hosts,
then transfer control to the application they infected.


Resident viruses – loads itself into memory on execution and then transfers
control to the application they infected. It stays active in the background and
spreads when possible. When the operating system performs certain actions,
the virus will spring into action and start to spread.




P6
Viruses

The possible hosts for a virus include:
•    Binary executable files
•    Volume Boot Records of hard disks/floppy disks
•    Master Boot Records
•    General-purpose scripts (batch scripts, shell scripts, VBScripts, etc.)
•    System specific autorun script files (e.g. Autorun.inf)
•    Documents that contain macros
•    Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in web applications
•    Arbitrary computer files (can be exploited by buffer overflow, format string
     or other)
•    Links (do not actually contain virus code, but the linked to site could in
     scripts, or downloaded executable)




P7
Sophisticated Viruses

As anti-virus systems have developed to detect viruses, viruses have grown more
complex and use sophisticated methods to avoid detection.


Viruses may infect files without modifying the size or timestamp (but will still be detected
through checksums). Some viruses attempt to disable anti-virus software.


Alternatively, a virus might avoid infecting AV files (or any bait files the AV system
creates/monitors) as these will be closely checked.
A virus might also try to intercept any requests made to the operating system and return
fake “clean” results.


Most AV predominately rely on signatures, identifying patterns of code in an infected file.
To prevent this, viruses can often modify themselves on each infection. More advanced
methods use simple encryption to encipher (the bulk of) the code. Polymorphic viruses
will mutate while keeping the original algorithm intact, so the code will look different, but
the effect remains the same.



P8
Worms

A worm is a program that actively transmits itself over a network to infect
other computers. It may also carry a payload.

The First worm: On November 2, 1988, Robert T. Morris (Jr.), a Cornell University
graduate student, unleashed a worm onto the Internet from MIT that infected between
6,000 and 9,000 computers, a significant portion at the time. He was a computer science
student and claimed that he was interested in determining how far and how quickly the
worm could spread throughout the network, but he did not anticipate that it would cause as
much trouble as it did due to his own coding error on the program's logic. He was
convicted and sentenced to three years of probation and 400 hours of community service,
in addition to a $10,000 fine. The program took advantage of a hole in the debug mode of
the Unix sendmail program, which runs on a system and waits for other systems to
connect to it and give it email, and a hole in the finger daemon fingerd, which serves finger
requests.




P9
Worms

Whereas viruses tend to cause damage to the target computer, worms do more
damage to the network, consuming bandwidth and denial of service.
The payload may do more than just spread the worm. It may:
•     Delete files
•     Encrypt files (for extortion)
•     Send documents via email
•     Install a backdoor/create a “bot”
•     Send spam
•     Launch a DoS


Worms exploit vulnerabilities in systems to propagate, so can be defended
against by applying regular security updates/patches. End users need also be
careful as worms can spread through email.



P10
Trojans

 “A Trojan is a harmful piece of software that looks legitimate. Users are
 typically tricked into loading and executing it on their systems.”

 There is no limit to what type of program a Trojan can appear to be. Malware
 authors can go to great lengths to create apps to get their code on other users,
 or even inject it into someone else’s if it isn’t hosted securely.


 Trojans are typically smaller applications: screensavers, simple hacking tools,
 add-ons, cracks to run popular games without the disks, anything that a user
 would not get at a reputable website (and needs to go to an untrusted one).


 Unlike viruses or worms, self-propagation is not a features of Trojans. However,
 due to their exploitation of peoples desires for free software, they are just as
 widespread (sometimes more so).



 P11
Keystroke loggers (Keyloggers)

A keylogger is a type of surveillance software (considered to be either software
or hardware) that has the capability to record every keystroke you make to a log
file, usually encrypted.


A keylogger can record instant messages, e-mail, and any information you type
at any time using your keyboard. The log file created by the keylogger can then
be sent to a specified receiver. Some keylogger programs will also record any e-
mail addresses you use and Web site URLs you visit.


Keyloggers, as a surveillance tool, are often used by employers to ensure
employees use work computers for business purposes only. Unfortunately,
keyloggers can also be embedded in spyware allowing your information to be
transmitted to an unknown third party.


The most dangerous aspect of keyloggers is that they can capture information
before it is encrypted, defeating any number of protection methods.

 P12
Hardware Keylogger


Independent hardware devices attached to the machine to be monitored.
Hard to detect unless they are specifically looked for (visually, no scans
would reveal them). Usually require the attacker to regain access to get the
data, but more sophisticated devices will be able to broadcast it.


•   KeyLlama 4MB PS/2 KeyLogger - Price: $60.88
•   KeyLlama 4MB USB KeyLogger - Price: $92.88

P13
Software keyloggers


More widely used as they can be installed remotely as part of an attack. Data
is emailed out from the monitored machine regularly. Software keyloggers are
not limited by physical memory allocations and so can store more information.

•   Keyboard Spectator Free
•   Ardamax Keylogger Lite
•   Quick Free Keylogger
•   Shadow Keylogger (Portable) 1.1.0 freeware




P14
Spyware

Spyware is a type of malware that is installed on computers and collects
information about users without their knowledge. Typically, spyware is secretly
installed on the user's personal computer. Sometimes, however, spyware,
such as keyloggers, are installed by the owner of a shared, corporate, or public
computer on purpose in order to monitor other users. Spyware can monitor any
of the following:


•     Keystrokes
•     Email messages
•     IM chat sessions
•     Websites visited
•     Applications opened
•     Screenshots
•     Clipboard



P15
Spyware

 Spyware generally gets installed through misleading the user or by exploiting
 vulnerabilities.


 The user might be presented with a useful utility (e.g. “web accelerator” or
 helpful software agent), which fails to mention what happens in the
 background. It may come coupled with a desirable piece of software (many
 p2p programs come bundled with an offer of spyware). Or it might be delivered
 via a drive-by downloads/installs.


 Spyware is most often financially motivated. The monitoring of internet habits
 can be used to provide targeted advertisements, ads that are tailored to the
 individual and so more likely to be of interest. These are usually in the form of
 pop-up windows.




P16
Spyware

 While the term spyware suggests software that secretly monitors the user's
 computing, the functions of spyware extend well beyond simple monitoring.
 Spyware programs can collect various types of personal information, such as
 Internet surfing habits and sites that have been visited, but can also interfere
 with user control of the computer in other ways, such as installing additional
 software and redirecting Web browser activity.


 Spyware is known to change computer settings, resulting in slow connection
 speeds, different home pages, and/or loss of Internet or functionality of other
 programs.


 Where multiple infections occur, the machine is likely to suffer severe instability
 as the different spyware programs conflict. Some spyware even disables
 security settings to allow further installations.

•   Zlob - Masquerades as a needed video codec. Redirects the default
    internet search and home pages, attempts to download and execute
    malicious software.




P19
Fake AV

Illegitimate AV:
•       Programs that report pop-up warnings and alarms
             • Windows Security alert
             • Windows reports that computer is infected.
             • Antivirus software helps to protect your computer against viruses and other
               security threats.
             • Click here for the scan your computer.
             • Your system might be at risk now.
•       Users are then directed to download AV software where they
        have to pay. The downloaded AV software typically contains
        more trojans or does nothing.
•       Recent fake anti-virus sites have even been imitating the look and
        feel of the Windows user interface.
•       Big business these days
    –    15% of all malware these days are Fake AV
    –    Generates more revenue than legitimate AV



P20
Rootkits

 A rootkit is a piece of malicious code that goes to great lengths not to be
 discovered or, if discovered and removed, to reestablish itself wherever possible.
 Installation requires the attacker to have root or administrator access. Once
 installed, the rootkit maintains this access over time and actively hides its
 presence from other processes.


 Typically a rootkit will come with some malicious payload (keyloggers, sniffers,
 bot, spam delivery) and/or a backdoor which will also remain concealed. Rootkits
 are hard to detect with common antivirus programs.


 There are (a small minority of) examples of useful rootkits:
 •   Honeypots
 •   Anti-virus (Kaspersky)




 P21
Rootkits
 A rootkit generally works as follows: Whenever a user executes a command that
 would show the presence of the rootkit, the rootkit intercepts the call and filters
 the results. Interception is done by concepts of hooking! Rootkits can be
 implemented in a variety of different ways:


 Application level: The rootkit replaces or modifies existing application binaries
    using hooks, patches, injected code or other means
 Library level: Modifies the system libraries (DLLs in Windows) to hide its
    presence
 Kernel level: The rootkit adds/replaces code in the kernel or device drivers. Gives
    unrestricted access, and very difficult to detect. Can impact system stability if
    not well written.


 Recent research has been done on rootkits at even lower levels (hypervisor, boot
 loader, firmware, hardware).


 P22
Slide by Chris Ries, VigilantMinds Inc, on “Windows Rootkits”

 P23
Rootkits
 Detection:
 The problem with detecting an installed rootkit is that the operating system has
 been fundamentally compromised and cannot be trusted. Rootkit detectors on
 live systems are usually limited to being able to find a rootkit before it is installed.
 The most reliable method is to boot from a trusted medium (live CD, USB drive),
 and safely load the suspected drive.
 Security vendors have attempted to add rootkit detection abilities to their
 solutions, which has lead to a familiar struggle (counter-measure, counter-
 counter-measure).


 Prevention can be achieved by calculating hashes of all system files after a
 clean install and making a comparison at a later date to see what changes have
 been made.


 Cross-view comparison is a more effective mechanism to detect rootkits.


 P24
Backdoors

 A backdoor (or trapdoor) in a computer system (or a cryptosystem, or even in
 an algorithm) is a method of bypassing normal authentication or obtaining
 remote access to a computer, while intended to remain hidden to casual
 inspection.


 The backdoor may take the form of an installed program, a modification to a
 legitimate program or simply a leftover artifact from development.


 Once a system has been compromised, one or more backdoors may be
 installed in order to allow easier access in the future.


 Backdoors may also be installed prior to malicious software, to allow attackers
 entry.



 P25
Backdoors


Example: Back Orifice (BO)
This is a remote system administration tool or malicious backdoor depending
on your point of view. It was released in 1998 by the CULT OF THE DEAD
COW, to illustrate the lack of security in Windows 98. A server is installed on
one computer (does not require user intervention so can be delivered by a
Trojan), which allows that machine to be controlled remotely. The server can
hide from simple scans by the user, and can:
                  steal passwords            delete files
                  format hard disk           execute commands


BO can be detected by most antivirus programs.




P26
Botnets

Botnet is a term for a collection of software robots, or bots, that run
autonomously and automatically.


While the term "botnet" can be used to refer to any group of bots, such as IRC
bots, this word is generally used to refer to a collection of compromised
computers (called Zombie computers) running software, usually installed via
drive-by downloads exploiting Web browser vulnerabilities, worms, Trojan
horses, or backdoors, under a common command-and-control infrastructure.




P27
Botnets

The creator of the botnet, called the bot herder or bot master, controls the
collection of machines remotely. Commands will be sent to one or more C&C
servers and propagated through the botnet.


IRC is often used to control botnets because it is flexible, easy to use and
because public servers can be used as a communication medium. Simple
tricks can be done by attackers to cover their identity (anonymous proxies or
IP address spoofing).


Botnets are typically sold and used for such illegal activities as DDoS, spam,
click fraud, etc. The number of machines in a botnet tends to be in the
thousands, but examples with millions of infected machines have been found1.

P28
Sniffer

A sniffer is a program and/or device that monitors data travelling over a
network. This is a network analyzing tool that has both constructive and
destructive uses. There are many different tools available that vary from simple
command line interface to complicated GUI with statistics presented in a variety
of graphs/animations.


In an Ethernet environment, all machines receive packets meant for one
machine. If a packet is not meant for a machine they are supposed to discard
it. A sniffer will ignore this and can read all traffic passively. A switched network
is harder to sniff as the switch will intelligently route packets, but it is still
possible (using ARP spoofing or MAC flooding, which are active sniffing
methods).


The following protocols are vulnerable to sniffing (in that passwords and data
can be sent in the clear: HTTP, SNMP, NNTP, POP, IMAP, FTP.


P29
Logic bombs

Logic Bombs


Logic Bombs are pieces of code that are deliberately inserted into code in
order to cause damage to a system.


They are typically created by disgruntled/former employees.


They are not considered viruses because they do not replicate. They are not
even programs in their own right but rather camouflaged segments of other
programs.


The fact that they are written by developers who have complete access and in-
depth knowledge of the system means that they are very difficult to detect.

 P31
Malware Detection

Malware is a general term that covers a number of different classes of code.
Within each class, there is a large number of specimens, which is constantly
growing. The techniques to detect and remove malware have struggled to
keep up with the evolution of malware.


There are good general malware detection techniques, and several tools
specific to each class of malware.


But the tools are not 100% effective at detecting every threat, and complete
removal is not always possible.


The best defense is to prevent rather than to detect and clean up an
infection.



P32
Malware Detection

 Viruses have been around long enough to be known by most computer
 users. While laws exist in most counties to ban virus writing, the cost of
 catching and prosecuting means most authors go unpunished.
 It does not appear that the constant flow of new virus is going to be
 stemmed any time soon, so prevention and detection methods will be
 needed for the foreseeable future.


 General protection techniques:
 1. Restrict your file downloading to known or secure sources
 2. Do not open any e-mail attachment that was not expected
 3. Use an up-to-date anti-virus program or service
 4. Enable macro protection in applications
 5. Create backup copies of all your important data




P33
Malware Detection


Anti-virus software is software used to prevent, detect and remove malware,
including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, etc. There are two basic
techniques used:


1. Signature Scanning:
AV programs have a database of unique sequences of binary code that
identify malware (code signature). All programs will scan for these
signatures. Depending on the program and type of scan requested it might
only scan certain files (OS files, libraries, executables), or it might scan the
entire drive, opening archives and compressed files. The sheer number of
viruses in the wild (and their ability to permute themselves) means that it is
not feasible for an anti-virus program to search for all known viruses.




P34
Malware Detection
 New signatures are obtained by user reporting, research analysis and web
 searching. To date, there are 1.6 M signatures!


 Even ignoring the problem with numbers, there is still a fundamental
 problem with a signature approach, that it is reactive. There is a window of
 vulnerability the users are exposed to. The exploit cycle works as follows. A
 vulnerability becomes publicly known, a patch is developed, the patch is
 released, the patch is deployed.


 This cycle can take days, weeks or even months, depending on the
 priorities of the developer. And patches are not always applied. It is not
 uncommon for vulnerabilities to be exploited long after the patch has
 become available.


 The vulnerability can be exploited at any point up until deployment of the
 patch, even before the vulnerability is publicly known (zero day attack).


 P35
Malware Detection


Virus writers have adapted to signature scanning by creating polymorphic
viruses that change or encrypt themselves to avoid detection.


2. Heuristic Scanning:
The more sophisticated approach is to look for virus-like behaviour, not
often found in legitimate software programs. For example, a program will
rarely edit the Windows Registry, which is something viruses often do. This
method looks for malicious intent rather than a definite fingerprint. On
finding a suspicious file, the scanner may take different actions: advise the
user, quarantine the file, send the file to the AV company for further
analysis.




P36
Malware Detection

Here are some common approaches to heuristic scanning:


Content Filtering compares the scanned code with a built-in rule base that
classifies suspect behavior. This might include such actions as modifying
.exe files, making changes to the registry, changing personal settings. This
does not identify a specific virus, but looks for likely ways that a virus writer
might code the mechanism for propagation or payload delivery.


Sandboxing allows incoming code to run inside a simulation of the
computing environment. The code cannot harm or infect the rest of the
system. The sandboxing software looks for specific activities and will alert
the user if found, or run the program normally otherwise. Sandboxing can
defeat code obfuscation techniques as the virus will decode itself.




P37
Malware Detection


Behavior Analysis looks at the overall system performance. It tracks
everything the system does and monitors for any deviation from standard
operating procedures.


Application Whitelist uses a database of known good applications, rather
than try to classify all bad ones. Examples: Malwarebytes Anti-Malware,
Bit9 Parity and Savant Protection.


The main advantage of heuristic scanning is to potentially identify new
threats. The disadvantage is an inexact science, with many false positives
and false negatives. This can be seen in independent comparisons and
evaluations of AV programs.

Malware Detection

Integrity Checking: An alternative to scanning is integrity checking. A
snapshot of all the program files is taken initially, and at regular intervals
this is re-evaluated. The user is notified of any changes to the files.
Cryptographic hashes are used as well as time and size details. Tripwire1 is
probably the best know system integrity verifier.
This is useful against file infector viruses, but less so against macro/script
viruses that use documents that are expected to change regularly.


Scheduling: Most AV programs will schedule regular scans of the system.
This will find existing infections. Much more important is real-time scanning,
stopping viruses before they have a chance to execute on the local
machine. This can include e-mail scanning, download scanning, script
scanning, etc.

 Pricing model: There are free anti-virus programs (AVG, Avira, Avast), but
 commercial products tend to have more comprehensive features and more
 accuracy. Paid programs usually have a subscription cost for regular updates.


 Online Antivirus Services: Some companies offer on-demand online services
 for malware detection. These range from individual file scanner (Kaspersky File
 Scanner1), to complete scan from the browser (BitDefender Online Scanner2), to
 thin-client complete scan and removal (Trend Micro’s HouseCall3). These are
 generally free services, providing the security of their technology for free, and try
 to sell the convenience of the full product.
 Other important criteria include: ease of use, compatibility, GUI, language,
 additional protections (URL filter, HIPS), support, etc.

Malware Detection - Top 5 Malware

 The current most prevalent pieces of malware are:
                           Name                            # Infections
                      1    Net-Worm.Win32.Kido.ir          371564
                      2    Virus.Win32.Sality.aa           166100
                      3    Net-Worm.Win32.Kido.ih          150399
                      4    Trojan.JS.Agent.bhr             95226
                      5    Exploit.JS.Agent.bab            81681

 The Conficker/Kido worm uses several infection vectors: Autorun, NetBiOS,
 Dictionary attack on admin accounts, Windows exploits. Deploys spam bot and
 scareware. The Sality/Daprosy Worm spreads via LAN connections, USB
 devices and email (it actually disguises itself as an anti-virus product). It is
 known to log keystrokes to capture sensitive information.
