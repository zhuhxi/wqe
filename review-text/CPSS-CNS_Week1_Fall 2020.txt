 Introduction – Characteristics of Ubinet

 •     Heterogeneous nature of the UbiNet Environment.
     – A diversity of security mechanisms and credentials have to be
       integrated and managed.
 •     Dynamic nature of the UbiNet Environment
     – It challenges maintaining continuity of security as the topology changes
 •     Trust
     – It is difficult to establish trust in new devices as they join/leave the
       UbiNet Environment including Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET).
     – MANETs with a very limited coverage and without the need for
       infrastructure
 •     Where do we currently stand?
     – Ubiquitous services such as currently mostly “location-based”, home
       networking, Remote monitoring, home/office/shopping/healthcare
       applications.

      Key Establishment
    – Key Agreement (e.g. Diffie-Hellman key agreement)
    – Key Transport (Transfer of a specific key chose a priori by one party)


•     Symmetric key transport and derivation with a server
    – Symmetric Key Transport with Server-Based Protocols

•     Asymmetric or ID-based cryptography is appropriate for Mobile Ad hoc
      Networks (MANET) to authenticate nodes
    – Authenticated Group Key Agreement Protocols

Introduction to Cryptology Concepts (1/3)




The word Cryptology stems from Greek meaning “hidden word”.

Cryptology splits into two: Cryptography and Cryptanalysis.

Cryptography is the study of mathematical techniques related to
   aspects of information security such as confidentiality, integrity,
   authentication, availability, accountability and non-repudiation.

                          Basic Communication Scenario

P37
 Symmetric Key Cryptography



  Encryption and decryption keys are known to both
  i.e. Encryption key = Decryption key

  communicating parties (Alice and Bob).

  All of the classical (pre-1970) cryptosystems are symmetric.

  Examples : DES and AES (Rijndael)

  A Secret should be shared (or agreed) between the communicating
  parties.




P38
 Asymmetric Key Cryptography


  Public key encryption (invented in the late 1970s), involves a different
    model.

  Private Key - known only to the owner

  Public Key - known to anyone in the systems with assurance

  Sender encrypts the message by the Public Key of the receiver

  Only the receiver can decrypt the message by her/his Private Key

  Encryption key ≠ Decryption Key




P39
 Message Authentication Codes (MACs)



 MACs are designed to enable the recipient of a message to verify its
 origin and integrity.

 A MAC algorithm takes a secret key and a message as input and
 outputs a MAC (appended to the message as a type of integrity
    check).

 If recipient has the same secret key, the MAC can be computed on
  received message and compared with sent value.




P40
 Hash Functions


 Given arbitrary length m, compute constant length digest d = h(m)


 Desirable properties
     h(m) easy to compute given m
     One-way: given h(m), hard to find m
     Weakly collision free: given h(m) and m, hard to find m’ s.t. h(m) =
  h(m’)
     Strongly collision free: hard to find any x, y s.t. h(x) = h(y)

 Example use: password database, file distribution
 Common algorithms: MD5, SHA




P41
Digital signatures


Digital signatures are also a kind of public key cryptography.

For a digital signature algorithm, keys are again generated in pairs:
public verification keys and private signing keys.

Private signature key of sender applied to message to yield a digital
signature of the message.

Sent with message.

Any recipient with public verification key can check origin and integrity
of the message.



P42
MACs and Signatures


Whilst both MACs and signatures provide integrity and origin protection
for data, they have different characteristics.


A MAC relies on shared secrets, and hence is appropriate in a point-to-
point environment.


A signature enables the origin and integrity of a message to be
independently checked by many recipients, and hence fits well to a
broadcast or multicast environment.




P43
 Non-repudiation


 Digital signatures can also provide non-repudiation.

 Since verifier has only the public key, they cannot create signatures
 (compare with MACs).

 Hence a digitally signed message may be of value as long term
 evidence of an event, which cannot be repudiated by the originator of
 the signature.




P44
Authentication protocols


 An authentication protocol is a cryptography-based exchange of
 messages, designed to enable participants to verify who it is they are
 communicating with.


 Typically the protocols use MACs or signatures to protect individual
 messages.


 However, apart from use of cryptography, means are required to verify
 that messages are not replays of old (valid) messages.




P45
Security threats and services



 All cryptographic schemes are designed to counter security threats.


 Threats include:
      Eavesdropping on communications
      Masquerade
      Manipulation of communications
      Repudiation
      DoS




P46
Addressing threats by Cryptanalysis


A ‘Security service’ is a term for the provision of protection against a threat.


Examples include:
      Confidentiality (to defeat eavesdropping);
      Entity authentication (to defeat masquerade);
      Integrity protection (to defeat manipulation);
      Non-repudiation (to defeat repudiation).

Security services include as follows:
      Encryption can provide confidentiality;
      Authentication protocols can provide entity authentication;
      MACs or digital signatures can provide integrity protection;
      Digital signatures can provide non-repudiation.




P47
 Key management and PKIs

  Any use of cryptography requires the generation and distribution of
  Key material (key management).

  Key management for public key cryptography rather different than for
  ‘secret key’ cryptography.

  Key management for secret key cryptography involves confidential and
  reliable transfer of secret keys.

  Key management for public key cryptography is simpler – public keys
  are not secret.

  However public keys still need to be reliably transferred.




P48
Public key certificates

The Certificate Authority (CA) signs a concatenation of the public
key, client name, and expiry date to form a public key certificate.


Anyone who verifies a public key certificate then has a reliable
copy of the public key of the certificate owner.


Certificates (i.e. data structures signed by a Trusted Third Party,
i.e. CA) can be used for things other then public keys.


An Attribute Authority can create Attribute Certificates, granting
the owner privileges.


E.g. a network operator could sign an attribute certificate saying
that a particular software vendor is reliable.




  P49
Authorisation and access control


Authorisation is a term relating to the notion of access control.

Any system will often need to make a decision about whether another
entity should be allowed to perform a particular action.

This is normally referred to as access control.
